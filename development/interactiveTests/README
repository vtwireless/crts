A bunch of scripts that run interactive tests.

These programs require X11 windows and xterm.

TODO:
We still need to come up with a method to find the USRPs and their
available channels and IP addresses.  So these tests need to be edited to
work in most cases.  Some will not run at all if you do not have enough
USRPs.


# tests on particular computers:

# on CORNET-Node-2-2-Port-7014 and CORNET-Node-2-1-Port-7013

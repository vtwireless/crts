# Installation prefixes and git tag releases


# These values may be over ridden in ./prefixes
# 
# Just copy this file to ./prefixes and then change the values to what you
# like.
#
# You need to check the github.com repos for what tags are available
# if you wish to change to a different release.  You may see a list of
# git tags in the corresponding download (dl) file in */*.tar.gz.dl

# Download, build, and install all these packages.
# The GitHub URLs are gotten in the files */*.tar.gz.dl also there
# are sha512 hashes that are checked for the downloaded tarball files.
# There will be a different sha512 hash for a given git tag tarball.
#
# The files in the subdirectories depend on these bash variables, and will
# source this file to get these values.  Use the file ./prefix to make
# edits that override any of these values.
#
# If you change any tags you'll need to test that all your tags have
# compatible versions of the packages.

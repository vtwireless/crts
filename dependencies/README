This directory provides scripts that install software packages that CRTS
depends on.  You need to run ../bootstrap before using these scripts.

Each package is in a different directory.  We made an effort to configure
all of the packages for use by CRTS.  All of these packages can be built
and installed from GitHub source with the git tags that are listed in
default_prefixes, or (overridden) in prefixes if found.  The size of all
the files in this directory is intended to be small until the packages
are downloaded and built.  At the time of this writing the total file
space in this directory was 220 Kilo bytes (Nov 19 2018), so we see no
need to put these files in a different repository.


Some of the package versions may be newer than what is available from APT
(the Debian package management system) repositories.  Hence this directory
exists.


Some of the packages listed in this directory are not required except for
CRTS development.  Some may never be required.


There are two levels of software package perquisites:

   1. those software packages that are available through the operating
      system package manager, APT (apt-get install), and

   2. those software packages that are not available through APT.




1.  run: "sudo ./apt-getDependencies.bash" to install packages that are
requirements on Debian or Ubuntu systems, or at you option look at the
apt-getDependencies.bash script and install the packages yourself.



2.  CRTS currently depends on (as of Nov 19 2018):

    node

    uhd

    gnuradio


    the rest of the directories may or may not end up be required in
    the future.





Directories (PACKAGE_DIR):


  gnuradio            - https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio

  hiredis             - https://github.com/redis/hiredis

  libwebsockets       - https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets

  mosquitto           - https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto

  mosquitto-auth-plug - https://github.com/jpmens/mosquitto-auth-plug

  mqttc (paho.mqtt.c) - https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c

  node                - https://github.com/nodejs/node

  redis               - https://github.com/antirez/redis

  slurm               - https://github.com/SchedMD/slurm

  uhd                 - https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd



The order of things:

  gnuradio depends on uhd

  mosquitto depends on libwebsockets

  mosquitto-auth-plug depends on mosquitto, redis, and hiredis



Instructions for installing any of those packages: 


  cp default_prefixes prefixes
  
  Edit the file prefixes to set your installation prefix directories to
  suit your preferences.

  For each package:

  cd PACKAGE_DIR && make && make install && cd ..

  Then you need to make the package accessible by setting your PATH, or
  use other means.



Another way via LinuxBrew:

  1.  You need to install those software packages that are available through the operating
      system package manager, see above, and

  2.  The script in ../INSTALL_via_LinuxBrew can be used to install the
      those software packages that are not available through APT including
      this CRTS.  Run `../INSTALL_via_LinuxBrew --help` for options.

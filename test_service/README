CRTS Test Service

This directory has files that are specific to a CRTS service scenario.  If
you need to make a specific CRTS service scenario you could start by
copying all the files in this directory, and then edit every file.

There are a lot of more generic CRTS service files that this CRTS service
scenario uses in other directories.

Edit test_server and then run it.  Then browse the web pages from the
printed URL that the test_server printed to standard out.

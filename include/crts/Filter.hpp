/** A filter component module base class.
 *
 * We say that in general a filter reads inputs and writes outputs.
 *
 * A source filter has no input and a sink filter has no output.
 *
 * We use the word filter to refer to general data processing component.
 * Systems engineers would likely not want to refer to these
 * data processing components as filters, but strictly speaking they are
 * software filters, ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(software),
 * so we call them filters which is short for "software filters".
 * Some CRTSFilter objects have zero input, but the interface to these
 * filters with no inputs is the same as the filters with input, so they
 * are filters with null inputs.  We call them source filters.
 *
 *
 * The Unix philosophy encourages combining small, discrete tools to
 * accomplish larger tasks.  Reference: 
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(software)#Unix
 *
 * A stream can be thought of as items on a conveyor belt being processed
 * one at a time.  In our case in CRTSFilters are placed at points along
 * the conveyor belt to transform the data stream as it flows.
 * This idea of "stream" seems to fit what we are doing.  We assemble
 * CRTSFilters along our stream.  Reference:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing)
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(software)
 *
 *
 * When these modules run the coding interfaces are such that we do not
 * have to know if these modules run on separate threads or not.  Wither
 * or not these modules run on different threads is decided at run time.
 * This is a requirement so that run/start time optimization is possible.
 *
 * Sometimes things are so simple that running a single thread is much
 * faster than running more than one thread; and sometimes processing in a
 * module takes so long that multi-threading, and multi-buffering between,
 * the modules is faster.  We can test different filter/thread topologies
 * on the fly and the filter writer does not have to be concerned about
 * threading, which is a run time decision.  The cost for such flexibility 
 * is requiring a particular interface, the CRTSFilter object.

// TODO:  It may be possible to make parts of this stream have CRTSFilter
// modules running in different processes, not just threads.  This should
// be able to be added seamlessly at without changing the users CRTSFilter
// code.
//
//
//
//         CRTSFilter trade-offs and considerations:
//
// If unlocked thread looping process time, for more than one thread in
// the stream, is much greater than inter thread contention time per loop,
// then we will get better performance with multi-threading.  If one
// module thread is the bottle-neck (slower than all others) than there
